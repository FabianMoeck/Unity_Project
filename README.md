# Unity_Project
 
This Project was the final project during the education at bib.
The FPS was developed in teams of 8.
My part was to implement the gameplay mechancis and later coordinating with the team member who did work on the multiplayer aspect how the ideas could be synchronized.
The machanics involved:
- movement
- weapon behaviour
- character skills
- player health
- game mechanics (planting / defusing bomb)
